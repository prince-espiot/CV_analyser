# CV_analyser
The software application was developed using a combination of programming lan-
guages, including but not limited to TypeScript, Python, and CSS. The application
architecture comprises two fundamental components: the frontend and the backend,
which houses the client and server, respectively. The frontend component is respon-
sible for handling the user interface and user interaction. On the other hand, the
backend component is responsible for processing data and performing various com-
putations. The communication and data exchange between the frontend and back-
end components are facilitated using APIs. To provide a visual representation of
the application architecture, a figure has been included below that highlights the
relationship between the two components. The frontend component is designed to
communicate with the backend component to retrieve and display data on the user
interface. In contrast, the backend component receives requests from the frontend
and processes data accordingly. By dividing the application into two separate com-
ponents, the software provides a modular architecture that is flexible, scalable, and
easier to maintain.
